# SZCupMMC_Project_2023Fall
This is the project detail in the 2023 Shenzhen Cup Mathematical Modeling Challenge, which developed a new DCT algorithm to hide huge amounts of information in a single picture. Nearly all of the materials are written in Chinese. I wrote the slides, report and the portfolio. You can see the contest problem [here](http://www.m2ct.org/view-page.jsp?editId=12&uri=0D00278&gobackUrl=modular-list.jsp&pageType=smxly&menuType=flowUp).

In the context of the 2023 Shenzhen Cup Mathematical Modeling Challenge, we advanced a novel DCT graph steganography technique predicated on the principles of JPG image generation. This technological innovation attained the status of a finalist due to its efficacy in concealing a substantial volume of information within a singular image, while incurring minimal visual loss. To elucidate further, the technique adeptly obscured over 170,000 Chinese characters encoded in GBK, equivalent to approximately 60,000 English words in UTF-8, all the while preserving a visual similarity exceeding 98%, as measured by conventional metrics (RMSE/UQI/SSIM/NC). 

Notably, the project marked the our inaugural foray into this domain, underscoring his exceptional adaptability and capacity to confront and surmount novel challenges with acumen.

Further, you can see our code [in this site](https://github.com/MingyangLi7278/2023shenzhencup-problemB), which were summarised by [Mingyang Li](https://github.com/MingyangLi7278). And the main programmer [Sihan Lan](https://www.zhihu.com/people/sihan-80-73) prepared the tutorials in [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/666786913). Apart from a promising data scientist, he is a great original folk singer. You can listen to his beautiful music [here](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=34908789).

Reading our [portfolio](https://github.com/BruceSheng1202/SZCupMMC_Project_2023Fall/blob/main/Portfolio_Introduction%20to%20the%20technique.pdf) and  [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/666786913), you can clearly understand our work. And there is a video about 1 minute in the tutorial, which shows how we store 18 times of "The third Amendment to the Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China" in a single picture with trivial visual loss.
